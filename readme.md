    2. Create a new droplet (virtual machine). To do this, select the operating system, server size and location.

    3. Create an ssh key on your computer, if you haven't already. This can be done using the ssh-keygen command in the terminal.

    4. Add your ssh key to the Digital Ocean server. You can do this while creating the droplet, or later in the "Security" section of the droplet management page.

    5. Save the IP address of your server.

    6. Connect to the server via terminal using the ssh root@IP-address command. Replace "IP address" with the previously saved IP address of your server.

    7. Install the necessary software for your project, such as nginx, Node.js, Python, etc.

    8.Clone your project to the server using git or scp command.

    9. Customize your project according to your software requirements and project task.
